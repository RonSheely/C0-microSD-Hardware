# Example Verilog Designs
This folder contains Verilog design examples for use with the Signaloid C0-microSD hot-swappable hardware module.

## Getting Started 
### Install the Open-Source Software toolchain
These examples require the open-source tools: [icestorm](https://github.com/YosysHQ/icestorm), [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr), and [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys).

For pre-compiled binaries of the open-source CAD toolchain, see https://github.com/YosysHQ/oss-cad-suite-build. You can also find two pre-compiled example bitstreams in the `bin/` directory of this repository.

Additionally, the `C0_microSD_toolkit.py` Python script, which is necessary for flashing new bitstreams to the device, requires `Python3.8` and above.
